## PR Template

### What iteration did you complete?

I got through part of Iteration 2, but I had to skip a little CS.

### How far into the iteration you were in progress on were you? Be specific.

I made it so that the clear button cleared the answer and question text.  I was not able to disable the clear button or make it so that the answer button only worked when a question was in it, but I had somewhat planned it out.

### What was most challenging about this for you?

The CS.  I spent way too long on it.  The random number generator took me a while as well because my partner did that part of the number guesser challenge, and I had to do some research to re-teach myself what he did.

### Please tag the instructor you were assigned to for this
